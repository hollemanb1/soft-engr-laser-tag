# main.py
"""
Main entry point for the Photon Game.

- Creates QApplication (Qt event loop).
- Builds the ScoreboardWindow (UI).
- Starts splash screen.
- Starts UDPTransport + GameCore (backend).
- Uses a QTimer to:
    * Pull new events from UDPTransport.event_queue
    * Process them with GameCore (updates state + DB)
    * Refresh the scoreboard UI
